# Nest Finder
## Introduction
Hi!

I am an NTIA student and this is my Python and Data Analytics project.

In this project I will demonstrate how to combine data from Real Estate Websites
with data available on Public Domain such as GIS data from City of Newton MA

This project can be cloned form:
https://github.com/Tasha-Tech/NestFinder.git

This project has several modules:

**adress**   # Property information from Newton City GIS data 

**schools**  # School information from Newton City GIS data

**on_sale**  # Houses on Sale information from www.movoto.com

**finder**   # Finder module "combines" information from modules above and populates SQL database
